PROMETHEUS AI // SYSTEM V2.0
Architect: Likith Naidu Anumakonda Date: December 25, 2025 Status: Operational (Local Host + Web Tunneling)

1. Project Objective
To build a completely free, private, and high-fidelity AI chatbot that runs locally on a MacBook Air (M1) without using paid API keys (like OpenAI). The system is fully custom-branded and deployed to the internet via a secure tunnel for integration into a personal portfolio.

2. The Tech Stack
Component	Technology	Purpose
The Brain	Ollama (Llama 3.2)	Runs the LLM locally on your hardware.
Backend	FastAPI	Middleware that receives user text and talks to Ollama.
Frontend	Streamlit	The visual chat interface (GUI).
Styling	Custom CSS	"Crystal Glass & Hologram" UI Design System.
Deployment	Ngrok	Tunnels localhost to a public URL (https://...).
Version Control	Git & GitHub	Code backup and repository management.
3. Development History (Step-by-Step)
Phase 1: Initialization
Action: Installed Ollama and pulled the llama3.2 model.
Verification: Confirmed the model runs in the terminal using ollama run llama3.2.
Phase 2: Backend Development (backend.py)
Action: Created a FastAPI server on Port 8000.
Logic: It accepts a JSON payload (prompt), sends it to the local Ollama API (http://localhost:11434/api/generate), and returns the response.
Phase 3: Frontend Evolution (frontend.py)
We iterated through three distinct design versions:
V1 (Basic): Standard Streamlit interface.
V2 (Cyber-Noir): Deep black "Obsidian" theme with lava-pulse animations. (Discarded due to low visibility of background photo).
V3 (Final - Crystal Glass):
Background: Custom image (LIKITH_NAIDU-ANUMAKONDA.png) with a 40% dark overlay.
UI Elements: Frosted glass message bubbles, rounded capsule input field, and neon cyan/orange accents.
Typography: "Rajdhani" and "Space Mono" fonts with heavy drop shadows for readability.
Phase 4: Version Control
Issue: Accidentally initialized Git in the Home Directory (~), causing "Operation not permitted" errors.
Fix: Removed the rogue .git folder, navigated to ~/my_chatbot, and initialized Git correctly.
Result: Code successfully pushed to GitHub repository: LIKITH-3012-MAC/my_chatbot.
Phase 5: Deployment & Integration
Issue: Ports 8000 and 8501 were blocked by "Zombie" processes.
Fix: Used kill -9 <PID> to clear the ports.
Ngrok: Authenticated with a token to create a secure tunnel.
Integration: Generated an HTML <iframe> code snippet to embed the live chatbot into your personal portfolio website.
4. The Final Code Structure
Your folder ~/my_chatbot/ contains:
backend.py (Server logic)
frontend.py (UI & Design)
LIKITH_NAIDU-ANUMAKONDA.png (Background asset)
.gitignore (System file)
.git/ (Repository data)
5. User Manual: How to Launch
Since this is a local-first AI, it does not run 24/7 on the cloud. You must turn the key to start the engine.

Startup Sequence (The "3-Terminal" Method)
Step 1: Start the Backend (Terminal 1)

Bash
cd ~/my_chatbot
uvicorn backend:app --reload --port 8000
Wait for: "Application startup complete"

Step 2: Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)

Bash
cd ~/my_chatbot
streamlit run frontend.py --server.port 8501
Step 3: Open the Tunnel (Terminal 3)

Bash
ngrok http 8501
Step 4: Connect
Copy the https://....ngrok-free.app link from Terminal 3.
Paste it into your Portfolio HTML code (src="...").
Prometheus AI is LIVE.
6. Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet
Error: Address already in use
Solution: Run lsof -i :8000 (or 8501) and kill the PID.
Error: Ngrok authentication failed
Solution: Run ngrok config add-authtoken [YOUR_TOKEN].
Error: Background image not showing.
Solution: Ensure the PNG file is inside ~/my_chatbot and the filename in frontend.py matches exactly.
